# Export wifi information to Windows {#exporttowindows}
You can export the information of a wireless connection stored in an database entry (back) to the windows system by right click on it `Selected Entries` &rarr; `In Windows einf&uuml;gen`.

### Warning
- If the windows system already knows a wifi connection with the same ssid, then this old information is deleted before inserting the new one!
- If the entry does not contain the valid information of a wifi connection, then context menu entry `In Windows einf&uuml;gen` will not exist.
