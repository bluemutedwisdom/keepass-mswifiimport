# Export wifi information to Windows {#exporttowindows}
You can export the information of a wireless connection stored in an database entry (back) to the windows system by right click on it `Selected Entries` &rarr; `In Windows einf&uuml;gen`.

### Warning
- If the windows system already knows a wifi connection with the same ssid, then this old information is deleted before inserting the new one!
- If the entry does not contain the valid information of a wifi connection, then context menu entry `In Windows einf&uuml;gen` will not exist.

### Why do we not use the normal "Export" dialog?
I think the main reason is that I do not fully understand the KeePass Interfaces and do not find any explanatin of it.

The reason is that we cannot export *every* entry, but only quite special ones. And I do not see how I can implement this using the export system of KeePass.
